Hey, I'm Rob.

I'm trying to make it as a Software Developer, currently working as an Intern Developer at [Semantico](http://semantico.com/ "Semantico").

I'm also a finalist at the University of Sussex, studying Computer Science.

I plan to occasionally write here about different things: probably just development and how I'm getting on as an Intern trying to make it as a developer.

Feel free to give me a shout if I you'd like to talk.
